# Project Setup
We use Conda for package / dependency management.  You can get a copy of conda for your platform here: https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

One can then create a suitable environment as follows:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate the environment with:

```
$ source activate cs230Project
```


We'll be using the CASIA dataset that's available at https://www.kaggle.com/sophatvathana/casia-dataset. Please download this and put under
a data/ folder.
